# :monkey: TAMP-adapted Model Zoo

Here we provide a model zoo that releases the adapted weights of our TAMP in different downstream tasks. If you want to contribute to the Model Zoo, please send the [EMAIL](mailto:ythe1995@163.com) to our group.

## News
- **2024.09.25** We have released the TAMP-S models that were evaluated in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01591).

## Model Record
### 1. [TAMP-S](https://seunic-my.sharepoint.cn/:f:/g/personal/220232198_seu_edu_cn/EqZML5JjkP9FtqUbhmytor0B0d99OmORaKeoqBySK2oDaQ?e=nEfALO)
- **Adaptation method:** Low-rank adaptation
- **NICT setting:** Low-dose CT, Sparse-view CT, and Limited-angle CT
- **Target:** Whole human body, abdomen, and chest
- **Dataset:** AutoPET, AMOS, and COVID-19
- **Description:** **27** simulation-based adaptation models evaluated in our paper. These models are adapted to three NICT settings with different defect degrees.
