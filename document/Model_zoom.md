# :monkey: MITAMP-adapted Model Zoo

Here we provide a model zoo that releases the adapted weights of our MITAMP in different downstream tasks. If you want to contribute to the Model Zoo, please send the [EMAIL](mailto:ythe1995@163.com) to our group.

## News
- **2024.09.25** We have released the MITAMP-S models that evaluated in our [paper](*******).

## Model Record
### 1. MITAMP-S
- **Adaptation method:** Low-rank adaptation
- **NICT setting:** Low-dose CT, Sparse-view CT, and Limited-angle CT
- **Target:** Whole human body, abdomen, and chest
- **Dataset:** AutoPET, AMOS, and COVID-19
- **Description:** **27** simulation-based adaptation models that evaluated in our paper. These models are adapted to three kinds of NICT settings with different defect degrees.
