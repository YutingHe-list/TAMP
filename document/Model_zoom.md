# MITAMP-Adapted Model Zoom

Here we provide a model zoom that releases the adapted weights of our MITAMP in different downstream tasks.

## News

- **NICT setting:** Low-dose CT, Sparse-view CT, Limited-angle CT
- **Target:** Whole human body
- **Dataset:** AutoPET, AMOS, COVID-19
- **Description:** 27 simulation-based adaptation models that evaluated in our paper. These models are adapted to three kinds of NICT settings with different defect degree.
