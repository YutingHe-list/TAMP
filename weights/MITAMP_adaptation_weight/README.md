After [adaptation](../../README.md#41-model-adaptation), the LoRA weight of MITAMP-S will be placed in this folder. 

You also can find some adapted MITAMP weights for different specific scenarios in the [MITAMP-adapted Model Zoo](https://github.com/YutingHe-list/MITAMP/blob/main/document/Model_zoom.md). Download and save them here as needed.
